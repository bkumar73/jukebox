The Model Registry can catalog, list, index, share, record, organize this information. This allows the Data Scientist to compare different versions and revert to previous versions if needed.\n",

    "- Track and compare performance: View key metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision for each model version. This helps identify the best-performing model for deployment.\n",
